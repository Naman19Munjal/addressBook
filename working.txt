I have added an authentication system to show working of jwt.
1.) /signup is the first api to be used to register yourself.
2.) use /login endpoint after that for login purpose.
after that all the other routes are accessible.

/getAllUsers is the endpoint for viewing all the records(users) in the address book/database.

Open the project in an editor, use (npm install) and then use (npm run dev) commands in the terminal.
Use Postman to check the working of all the api endpoints.
